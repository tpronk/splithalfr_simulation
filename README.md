# A set of simulations to validate the permutated splitting algorithm of the [splithalfr R package](https://github.com/tpronk/splithalfr)

These simulations were aimed to computationally reproduce an equivalence that has been proven analytically in extant research. Namely, that for scores generated by an essentially tau-equivalent model (i.e. a single factor model with equal factor loadings), the mean Flanagan-Rulon coefficient of all possible splits of a test approaches Cronbach's alpha ([Novick & Lewis, 1967](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400); [Warrens, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-19977-1)).

To this end, tests were simulated in which 1000 participants answered 50 items. Each participant had a trait score T, which was drawn from a standard normal distribution. Each item score was the sum of the participant’s trait score and a noise term E drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a 
standard deviation of Y. In nine simulations, Y was varied from 1 to 9, reflecting tests that were increasingly unreliable in measuring the trait T. For each simulation, Cronbach’s alpha was calculated via the [psyc](https://cran.r-project.org/package=psych) package, as well as the mean Flanagan-Rulon coefficient over 1000 random splits via the [splithalfr package](https://github.com/tpronk/splithalfr).
