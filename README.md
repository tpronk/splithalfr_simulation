# A set of simulations to validate the splitting algorithm of the [splithalfr R package](https://github.com/tpronk/splithalfr)

These simulations were aimed to computationally reproduce an equivalence that has been proven analytically in extant research. Namely, that for scores generated by a single factor model with equal factor loadings the mean Flanagan-Rulon coefficient 
of all possible splits of a test approaches Cronbach's alpha. To this end, tests were simulated in which 1000 participants answered 50 items. Each participant had a trait score T which was drawn from a standard normal distribution. Each item score was the sum of the participant’s trait score and a noise term E drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a 
standard deviation of Y. In nine simulations, Y was varied from 1 to 9, reflecting tests that were increasingly unreliable in measuring the trait T. For each simulation, Cronbach’s alpha was calculated via the psych package, as well as the mean Flanagan-Rulon coefficient over 1000 random splits via the splithalfr package.
